The file "mnist.ipynb" executes the k-nearest neighbour algorithm on the MNIST dataset after converting each 28\*28 grayscale image into a 784\*1 vector.

The file "cifar10.ipynb" executes the k-nearest neighbour algorithm on the CIFAR-10 dataset after converting each 32\*32\*3 RGB image into a histogram of pixel intensities. We obtain a 768\*1 vector of each image where the first 256 rows represent the occurence of each pixel intensity in the red image, followed by 256 rows each for the green and blue images.

The confusion matrix and accuracy score is computed for both tasks.
